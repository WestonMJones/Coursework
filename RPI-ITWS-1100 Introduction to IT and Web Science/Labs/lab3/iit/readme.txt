This was a fun lab. I like the idea of having a personal website to refer people too -- it's
something I worked on a bit over the summer -- but it's nice that I'll be forced to keep updating
it as the semester goes on. 

Regarding folder structure I chose the following layout (arrows denote folders and indentation denotes the hierachy):

index
resources -->
	images
	css
	pages -->
		project_resources -->
			Labx -->

It makes sense to have general folders for CSS and images -- these will be places to store content
that is general to every page on the website.

I divided more specific resources in the project_resources folder and subfolders because to me, it doesn't make
organizational sense to cram everything in the same global images folder. Also this way, URIs to refer to project resources
are significantly shorter and less complicated.
