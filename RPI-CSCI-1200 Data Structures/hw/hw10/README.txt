MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
Optional, please be concise!

I was a little confused as to what my output should be when using the complete pokedex.

My program counts all 721 pokemon, but it only counts the pokemon in my original list of 10 when tallying the number of pokemon in each egg group.

This seems a little wierd to me, but the pdf and piazza posts say that we should be making a few empty constructor classes for the egg groups
that won't be used by our list of pokemon, so I think I'm doing it right...
