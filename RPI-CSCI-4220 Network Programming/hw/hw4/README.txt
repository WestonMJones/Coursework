I worked alone on this assignment.
Weston Jones (jonesw3@rpi.edu)


I used two threads in my program. One thread handles user input / the "client side"
the other thread listens for incoming messages and handles the "server" side using select.

SHA1 wasn't working on my machine, so I just used my own function that produces 8 bit hashes.

I have 5 late days to use. While only 4 can be used on this assignment,
I might submit a couple times after midnight to make sure everything works.

Submitty generally gives us a couple extra hours for free, and my extra submissions will occur in the
early morning and so probably won't slow down your grading. Still, if you feel like giving me less points =(
then just grade the latest assignment that's only 4 days late please.


This assigment was super complicated and really long =(
Plz have mercy on future neg prog classes
