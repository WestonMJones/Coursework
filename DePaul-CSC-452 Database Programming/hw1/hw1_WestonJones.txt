--Question 1
SELECT EMP.ENAME, EMP.SAL, DEPT.DNAME FROM EMP INNER JOIN DEPT ON EMP.DEPTNO=dept.deptno WHERE COMM IS NULL AND SAL < 2000 

--Question 2
-- I interpretted this question such that only employees who work in dept 20 and whose managers also work in dept 20 will be retrieved.
-- One can easily modify the last two AND statements to broaden the deptartment search criteria.   
SELECT A.ENAME AS Employee, A.SAL AS EmployeeSalary, B.ENAME AS Manager, B.SAL AS ManagerSalary
FROM EMP A, EMP B
WHERE A.EMPNO <> B.EMPNO 
AND A.MGR = B.EMPNO
AND A.DEPTNO=20
AND B.DEPTNO=20

--Question 3
SELECT DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID FROM EMPLOYEES
LEFT OUTER JOIN DEPARTMENTS ON EMPLOYEES.DEPARTMENT_ID = DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID
WHERE EMPLOYEES.DEPARTMENT_ID IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_NAME

--Question 4
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENT_NAME
FROM DEPARTMENTS
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID NOT IN (
    SELECT DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID FROM EMPLOYEES
    LEFT OUTER JOIN DEPARTMENTS ON EMPLOYEES.DEPARTMENT_ID = DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID
    WHERE EMPLOYEES.DEPARTMENT_ID IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_ID, DEPARTMENTS.DEPARTMENT_NAME
)

--Question 5
SELECT A.LAST_NAME, A.FIRST_NAME, B.LAST_NAME AS Manager
FROM EMPLOYEES A, EMPLOYEES B
WHERE A.EMPLOYEE_ID <> B.EMPLOYEE_ID
AND A.MANAGER_ID = B.EMPLOYEE_ID
AND a.department_id IS NULL

--Question 6
SELECT DEPARTMENT_ID, MAX( (salary + salary * NVL (commission_PCT, 0) )) AS MaxSalary, 
MIN( (salary + salary * NVL (commission_PCT, 0) )) AS MinSalary  FROM employees
WHERE DEPARTMENT_ID IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT_ID
ORDER BY DEPARTMENT_ID

--Question 7
SELECT EMPLOYEE_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, DEPARTMENT_ID FROM EMPLOYEES
where last_name in
 (select last_name from employees
 group by last_name
 having count(*) > 1)

SELECT * FROM tab

--Question 10

DECLARE
  emp_name VARCHAR2( 15 );
