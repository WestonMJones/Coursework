LECTURE 12 PRACTICE PROBLEM SOLUTIONS
-------------------------------------

Read 3.1-3.5 and make sure you understand:

Boyce-Codd Normal Form
Algorithm to decompose into BCNF relations
Dependency Preservation property (and how to test for it)
Lossless Join property (and how to test for it)


For DVD(DVDID, MovieID, Title, Genre, Length Rating), we have

F = { DVDID -> MovieID, Title, Genre, Length, Rating ;
	MovieID -> Title, Genre, Length, Rating }

1.

What functional dependency stops DVD from being in BCNF?

---

Check the determinant of each functional dependency:

{DVDID}+ = {DVDID, MovieID, Title, Genre, Length, Rating}
{DVDID} is a superkey

{MovieID}+ = {MovieID, Title, Genre, Length, Rating}
{MovieID} is not a superkey -- so DVD is not in BCNF.

---

2.

If we decompose DVD into relations in BCNF, what is the resulting decomposition?

---

DVD(DVDID, MovieID, Title, Genre, Length Rating)

Removing MovieID -> Title, Genre, Length, Rating yields:

R1(DVDID, MovieID)
R2(MovieID, Title, Genre, Length, Rating)

Both R1 and R2 are in BCNF, so this is the end result.

---

3.

Find the projection of F on the two relations in your decomposition.

---

Projection on R1: DVDID -> MovieID

Projection on R2: MovieID -> Title, Genre, Length, Rating

---

4.

Does the decomposition have the dependency preservation property?  

Explain why or why not.

---

Is the union of two projections  

{ DVDID -> MovieID ; MovieID -> Title, Genre, Length, Rating }

equivalent to F:

Can we derive DVDID -> MovieID, Title, Genre, Length, Rating ?
In the union, {DVDID}+ = {DVDID, MovieID, Title, Genre, Length, Rating}, so YES.

Can we derive MovieID -> Title, Genre, Length, Rating }
In the union, {MovieID, Title, Genre, Length, Rating}, so YES.

Since the union of the projections can derive everything in F,
the decomposition has the depencency preservation property.

---

5.

Does the decompsition have the lossless join property?  

Explain why or why not.

---

Using the binary lossless join test:

R1 intersection R2 = {MovieID}

R1 - R2 = {DVDID}
R2 - R1 = {Title, Genre, Length Rating}

Does MovieID -> DVDID? NO.
Does MovieID -> Title, Genre, Length, Rating? YES.

Therefore the decomposition has the lossless join property.
