SOLUTIONS FOR LECTURE 11 PRACTICE PROBLEMS
------------------------------------------

For R(A,B,C,D):

F = { A -> B ; B -> A ; B,C -> D }

1. Find as many superkeys of R as you can.

---

Superkeys:

AC, BC, ABC, ACD, BCD, ABCD

For each of these sets, the closure is ABCD.

---

2. Out of those superkeys, which ones are candidate keys?

---

Candidate keys:

AC, BC

For each of these sets, the set is a superkey but 
no proper subset of it is a superkey.

---

3. Which attributes are prime attributes?

---

A, B, C

These attributes are part of some candidate key.

---

4. Is R in BCNF?
(That is, does every functional dependency have a
superkey as its determinant?)

---

No. 

The determinants of A->B and B->A are not superkeys in R,
so R is not in BCNF.
