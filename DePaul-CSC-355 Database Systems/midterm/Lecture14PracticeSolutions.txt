LECTURE 14 PRACTICE PROBLEMS
----------------------------

Read 3.1-3.5 and make sure you understand:

Third Normal Form  (3NF)
Minimal basis (and how to construct one)
Algorithms for decomposition into BCNF and 3NF relations


Consider the relation R(A, B, C, D),

With F = {  A,B -> C,D  ;  C -> A,B,D  ;  D -> B  }

1. Find a minimal basis for F.

---

A,B -> C
C -> A
C -> D
D -> B

---

2. Use the minimal basis for F to find a decomposition of R into relations in 3NF.

---

R1(A,B,C)
R2(C,A,D)
R3(D,B)

R1 contains candidate keys {C} and {A,B}, and
R2 contains candidate keys {C} and {A,D}, so okay.
No relations are redundant, so okay.

---

3. While it is probably not what you came up with for Question 1, the set
	G = {  D->B  ;  C->B  ;  C->A  ;  A,B->D  ;  A,B->C  } is also a minimal
	basis for F.  If you used G as your minimal basis in the 3NF decomposition
	algorithm, what is the resulting decomposition?

---

We would start with R1(D,B), R2(C,B,A), R3(A,B,D,C).  
However, R1 and R2 are redundant (subsets of R3),
so we eliminate then and are left with just a single
relation -- R3(A,B,D,C) -- which is the same as R!

---

4. Was R already in 3NF?

---

There are three candidate keys -- {C}, {A,B}, and {A,D}.
Therefore all four attributes are prime, so the right
side of every functional dependency is a prime attribute.
So yes, R was already in 3NF.  This explains the result 
of Question 3 -- we actually did not have to decompose R
at all!

---

5. Was R already in BCNF?

---

No, the determinant of D->B is not a superkey.
